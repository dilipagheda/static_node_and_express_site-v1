# About the project
This is the 6th Project as part of Full stack JavaScript Techdegree for Treehouse. It is about using node.js, express, pug and Json data 
to create a beautiful portfolio website.

The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and 
talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail a projects from this and other Techdegrees.

A JSON file is created that stores all the data about the projects.

Pug is used for templating that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

Node.js and Express is used to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
