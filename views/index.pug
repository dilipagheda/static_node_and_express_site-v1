        | These are the projects I built as part of Treehouse Fullstack Javascript Techdegree. Each project is unique and aimed towards building a specific skill such as Plain JavaScript, Object oriented programming with JavaScript, Client-side validations and error handling, building a game with animations, Fetch API, React.js, building a complete web application using Node.js and Express and building an API and integrating it in the web app.

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to create a projet img, title and link in the markup for each of 
      //the projects you are showcasing.  
      
      //- Use a combination of interpolation and template literals as needed to dynamically generate the the 
      //routes in the href, as well as the img's src and the projects title.
      
      //- Here's what the Pug for each project example should look like. 
      each project in projects
        .cell
          a(href=`project/${project.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`${project.image_urls[0]}`)
